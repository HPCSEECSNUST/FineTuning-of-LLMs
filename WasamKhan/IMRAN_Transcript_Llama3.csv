I mean it suits Pakistan very nicely, doesn't it?","I'm glad because we were anticipating the sort of blood bath that took place after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. Almost 200,000 Afghans died in that five to six year period, so we were petrified here that, when the US left, there would be a bloodbath. For Pakistan, there were consequences if this would have gone wrong. Most of all refugees. We already have three million refugees and we have no capacity to take any more. Secondly, if there was a protracted civil war in Afghanistan, which is also what we feared, because we never thought the Taliban would just take over Afghanistan; we thought they would immediately take over the Pashtun areas, but there would be, we thought, a civil war. So that too would have had implications for Pakistan.","Prime Minister I suppose you're quite glad about what's happened in Afghanistan. I mean it suits Pakistan very nicely, doesn't it?""But the Taliban are really a Pakistani creation, aren't they?","Absolutely not. Taliban were a creation of the environment. After the Soviets left, the war lords started fighting each other and, in that chaos, emerged Taliban. And, why did the Taliban emerge? Because they gave people a semblance of rule of law which did not exist before. Previously, before Taliban took over, at every 50 mile there was a checkpoint with a war lord who would take money. It was a fractured Afghanistan after the Soviets left.","But the Taliban are really a Pakistani creation, aren't they?""Sorry, excuse me, you were saying there wasn't a rule of law in Afghanistan the last 20 years when people's lives were lifted up beyond anything they had ever experienced?","No,  I'm talking about when Taliban took over in 96. I'm talking about that period, from 96 to 2001. They were not a creation of Pakistan. Pakistan, actually, was backing Gul Badin Hikmatyar. He was the faction Pakistan was backing against Ahmed Shah Masoud.","Sorry, excuse me, you were saying there wasn't a rule of law in Afghanistan the last 20 years when people's lives were lifted up beyond anything they had ever experienced?""Another extremist, another Islamic extremist? (Referring to backing Gul Badin Hikmatyar)","Well, all the mujahideen were fighting in the name of religion. They were doing jihad. They were all mujahideen. They weren't quite secular people who were still fighting the Soviets. All I'm saying is that when we backed one faction, in my opinion, we made a huge mistake because we should not have interfered. Whatever government the Afghans wanted; we should have backed them. So, when you back one faction, the other turns against you. In my opinion, it was a mistake made by Pakistan, but Taliban came out of nowhere at that time. I'm talking about 96.","Another extremist, another Islamic extremist? (Referring to backing Gul Badin Hikmatyar)""But now, they also came out of out of nowhere and most of educated people, the more kind of advanced people of Afghanistan, are leaving in their thousands because they're terrified of the organisation, which you actually seem to approve of.","this is just not true. First of all, you must understand that Afghanistan has a history. Afghanistan has resisted invaders throughout their history. I mean you would know the British, in 1842, when they invaded Afghanistan. Initially, it's a country which is easily invaded, but then starts the resistance and slowly it grows. It happened against the British, the same thing happened against the Soviets. Initially, there was hardly any fighting, but then gradually even when almost a million Afghans died, the fighting was more intense at the end. So similarly, when the Taliban were destroyed in 2001, initially there was nothing, but gradually the resistance grew. And, from people like us, from 2008 onward, I went specifically to America to tell the think tanks. I met senator Joe Biden, I met John Kerry, a senator at that time, and I explained to them that there was not going to be a military solution. But the US kept going for a military solution, which there wasn't one, so Pakistan was not responsible for this current situation. It was actually the coalition trying to find a military solution which didn't exist. We never knew what the USÕs idea of victory was in Afghanistan. I mean if it was Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda was decimated in the first two years. It was finished, so what what did US hope to achieve? Nation-building, democracy, liberating their women, whatever these aims were, these were not going to be attained through military action.","But now, they also came out of out of nowhere and most of educated people, the more kind of advanced people of Afghanistan, are leaving in their thousands because they're terrified of the organisation, which you actually seem to approve of.""When the Taliban took over, you were quoted as saying that Afghanistan had thrown off the shackles of slavery. You must be really embarrassed by that now, aren't you?","First of all, I was making a speech in Urdu. The speech was about single curriculum for the whole country. Pakistan inherited the sort of colonial system which was for a tiny elite. We had this two-tier system in Pakistan, one for the elites and one for the masses. So after 70 years, my government finally introduced a unified curriculum up till class five. I was inaugurating this curriculum and my exact words were that mental slavery is far more difficult to shed off than physical slavery. I mentioned Afghanistan in that context. It was just translated into English and came out not as I intended to.","When the Taliban took over, you were quoted as saying that Afghanistan had thrown off the shackles of slavery. You must be really embarrassed by that now, aren't you?""No, I understand that, but this is a really good opportunity for you now to say you condemn the excesses of the Taliban and that you feel that by, for instance, preventing women from getting a decent education, once again, they're taking the wrong direction. Would you like to say that to us now?","if anyone has any idea of what our religion was, it was a liberation of women 1500 years ago. When it came, our Prophet (peace be upon him), we regard him as someone who gave rights to women, who freed slaves, who gave equal rights to minorities, everyone was an equal citizen, he ended racism, so we look upon him at age of advent of Islam as enlightenment. And so, the idea that women should not get educated is just not Islamic. It might have been some rural culture in Afghanistan, but it has nothing to do with religion. The Taliban statements since they've assumed power have been encouraging. They have said they will have an inclusive government; they have said they'll give women right to work and education, they will give amnesty to everyone, the soil won't be used for terrorism by anyone. You know, these are encouraging statements.","No, I understand that, but this is a really good opportunity for you now to say you condemn the excesses of the Taliban and that you feel that by, for instance, preventing women from getting a decent education, once again, they're taking the wrong direction. Would you like to say that to us now?"So you're approving the way the Taliban are operating?,"No, I'm approving of what they have said. What happens now, I'm afraid John, I can't predict. In fact, no one can tell where Afghanistan goes from here, but what we hope and pray that finally after 40 years, the people of Afghanistan will have peace and stability.",So you're approving the way the Taliban are operating?And you'll give the Taliban time to show whether they're the kind of government that you can approve of or will you say to them that they've really got to shape up and behave properly?,"You know, John, I think this is a great opportunity for the international community to actually incentivize Taliban to walk the talk. As compared to last time, I find that the Taliban are seeking international acceptability. I think they recognize that the situation in Afghanistan, unless the international community helps them, this could really spiral out of control. And, it could really. There could be a huge humanitarian crisis. So I think that they are reaching out to the international community and that gives leverage to the international community to make sure the statements they've made, they actually implement them.",And you'll give the Taliban time to show whether they're the kind of government that you can approve of or will you say to them that they've really got to shape up and behave properly?"I must say, from my own experience in Afghanistan, what tends to happen is that the Taliban leaders say one thing, but real day-to-day moment by moment power exists in the hands of the vigilantes that go around the streets. They're the ones that decide what the state of Afghan kind of society is. It doesn't really matter what the top Taliban leaders say. Life is still going to be pretty terrible for ordinary Afghans.","again you know, I cannot say which way Afghanistan will go from here, and as I said we are quite tense. My biggest worry right now is the looming humanitarian crisis because, remember, 75 percent of Afghanistan's budget was foreign aid. Once you take away the foreign aid, they are facing a huge crisis ahead. So where Afghanistan goes from here, I don't know, but all I can say is that, from watching from the outside, there are factions within the Taliban. There are clearly the Taliban who are, at the moment, at the helm, are trying to get international acceptability. But then there are those who have been in the field for 20 years, who would claim that they had given a lot of sacrifices. I would imagine there would be a lot of problems within the Taliban so where this goes, as I said, I'm afraid IÕm not in a position to say what will happen, but I know what we want to happen is that if they can stick to the statements they've made, it could be a new beginning.","I must say, from my own experience in Afghanistan, what tends to happen is that the Taliban leaders say one thing, but real day-to-day moment by moment power exists in the hands of the vigilantes that go around the streets. They're the ones that decide what the state of Afghan kind of society is. It doesn't really matter what the top Taliban leaders say. Life is still going to be pretty terrible for ordinary Afghans.""Is that what you're the head of your intelligence organization, the ISI, told the Taliban leadership when he went there the other day?","His main concern is that there were three different terrorist groups that have been attacking Pakistan using the Afghan soil. One is ISIS. ISIS has conducted various attacks especially in Balochistan against the Shia minority, the Hazara community in Balochistan. Then there are the TTP, the Pakistani Taliban, who were pushed out from here and who were conducted attacks into Pakistan from Afghanistan. Recently, they conducted an attack and targeted the Chinese workers in Pakistan. Then, thirdly, the Baloch terrorists. The separatists who use Afghan soil to conduct attacks in Balochistan. So, our main concern is that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorism in Pakistan.","Is that what you're the head of your intelligence organization, the ISI, told the Taliban leadership when he went there the other day?""I just find it hard to understand how the Pakistan Taliban can be terrorists in Pakistan's view, but not the Taliban, that they support and have close links with in Afghanistan, surely they're terrorists too in those terms?","look, Pakistan sided with the United States's international coalition after 9 11. Pakistan is the country that suffered more than any other coalition partner. In fact, all the coalition partners of US, put together, did not even suffer a fraction of the casualties this country went through. 80 000 Pakistanis died because we joined this war against the Taliban. Remember, we were the coalition. All the logistical support to fight the Taliban or to dislodge them went through Pakistan. Pakistan was an ally. There was a point we thought we were going down because there were 50 different militant groups attacking the state of Pakistan and there were different types of Pakistani Talibans. There were no militant Taliban in Pakistan before we joined this coalition. The old mujahideen groups who we had trained, financed by the United States who were fighting the Soviets, they called Pakistan collaborators and targeted us. The reason why the Taliban are back in power is not because of Pakistan. If you want to know the real reason why they are back in power, all you have to do is do an analysis of why did 300 000 well equipped Afghan army give up without a fight to 70 000 militia. If you go into the details, which we have, that is the reason why the Taliban are back in power. It's not because of Pakistan.","I just find it hard to understand how the Pakistan Taliban can be terrorists in Pakistan's view, but not the Taliban, that they support and have close links with in Afghanistan, surely they're terrorists too in those terms?""And yet there is this constant link. I mean they started off in Pakistan, they had all the support of the ISI of Pakistan intelligence at the time. I mean I saw this for myself. And they're now back and there is a definite sense here that Pakistan has gained because India, your big opponent, has been thrown out of Afghanistan completely and you're the ones that are benefiting.","look, you must know the situation and you do know because you know this part of the world better than others. After the Soviets and the US left Afghanistan in the 80s, Pakistan at the time was left with 5 million refugees. 5 million refugees stayed in Pakistan. After 9 11, there were still three million refugees in Pakistan and all of them were Pashtuns. So, what happened after the Taliban were dislodged. Firstly, all along the border of Pakistan, called FATA or tribal areas, there were Pashtun tribes which were split by the Durand line where there was no border. There was a free flow of people right from the time, you know, since we existed. When the Soviets were in Afghanistan, this is from where the whole jihad was launched because there's no border there and it's 2600 kilometers of border between two countries.","And yet there is this constant link. I mean they started off in Pakistan, they had all the support of the ISI of Pakistan intelligence at the time. I mean I saw this for myself. And they're now back and there is a definite sense here that Pakistan has gained because India, your big opponent, has been thrown out of Afghanistan completely and you're the ones that are benefiting."Pakistan's got one really important lever that it can use to get what it wants in Afghanistan and that is the question of recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government. Are you going to do that?,"People don't understand the Afghan character. Afghans do not accept outside interference. We were three countries, in 2001, that that recognized the then Taliban government. After 9 11, the US asked us to help them flush out Al-Qaeda or ask the Taliban to give up Osama Bin Laden. Pakistan tried its best. They flatly refused Pakistan. So what you're saying is that Pakistan has this leverage about recognition. I just went to the SCO conference in Dushanbe and I spoke to all the neighbors, Iran, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, which is a very important country because there's a big Tajik minority in Afghanistan. I spoke to the Presidents there and all of us decided that we will collectively take a decision to recognize Afghanistan. The decision would depend upon will they have an inclusive government, their assurance of human rights and that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorism.",Pakistan's got one really important lever that it can use to get what it wants in Afghanistan and that is the question of recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government. Are you going to do that?"The fact is that Taliban aren't really going to have an inclusive government, are they? I mean they haven't even got the non-taliban people who've helped them into power.","So far, they havenÕt got an inclusive government, as we hoped they would. They say that this is just a transition, this is not a the final government and you know we are trying. We should speak to them and ensure that they do have an inclusive government because there will not be any long-term sustainable peace or stability in Afghanistan, unless all the factions and all the ethnic groups are represented.","The fact is that Taliban aren't really going to have an inclusive government, are they? I mean they haven't even got the non-taliban people who've helped them into power.""But I mean there's something more important than anything to the Taliban government and that's the kind of purity of their religious ideology. I mean they're never going to allow women to go to schools or anything like that, are they? Because it cuts across their whole notion of what a society should be.","I think they will allow women to go to schools. As far as we know they've assured us that they're doing it in phases. Look John, with what they do from now onwards, we can only hope to sort of persuade them and encourage them and incentivize them in that direction, but you know what happens, where they will go, I'm afraid I don't know.","But I mean there's something more important than anything to the Taliban government and that's the kind of purity of their religious ideology. I mean they're never going to allow women to go to schools or anything like that, are they? Because it cuts across their whole notion of what a society should be.""But you can influence it by helping the other countries around Afghanistan to decide to recognize them, or not recognize.","We have already. I told you, John, I've already spoken to all the neighbors. I have spoken to the Iranian President. I've spoken to the Tajikistan President and the Uzbekistan President. They're the most relevant and we have all decided that unless and until there's an inclusive government and their respect for human rights, it would not be possible for us to recognize them.","But you can influence it by helping the other countries around Afghanistan to decide to recognize them, or not recognize."So it really does depend on what they themselves do?,"Absolutely. Our biggest worry is that this will a huge humanitarian crisis and that would immediately lead to a refugee problem. Secondly, if they do not have an inclusive government and, gradually, it descends into a civil war, which it will if they do not include all the factions, that too will impact Pakistan. It will mean an unstable a chaotic Afghanistan. An ideal place for terrorists because if there's no control or if there's infighting going on, terrorism from Afghan soil will grow.",So it really does depend on what they themselves do?"Can I just ask you, just go back on something you said, the Taliban leadership has assured you or suggested that it will allow women's education again. How strong was the assurance?","No, they've given public statements. Their spokesman came on television and said the women will be allowed to work and they will be allowed to study. He just used the word Ôin the Islamic contextÕ. I guess what he means by Islamic context is that, you know, they will have segregation. In other words, they will not have co-education.","Can I just ask you, just go back on something you said, the Taliban leadership has assured you or suggested that it will allow women's education again. How strong was the assurance?""Before, of course, they would blow up girls schools and kill anybody in them.","I know, I mean, this idea of not allowing girls to study, believe me, has nothing to do with religion. I mean, in Pakistan, we give special stipends to our girls and the parents of girls. We give them extra money so that they would put their girls in school.","Before, of course, they would blow up girls schools and kill anybody in them.""So when you see what's happening in Afghanistan, you must be pretty disgusted actually with the way that the Taliban are behaving.","I think, what we should hope for and try for is to make them go into that direction. Afghans are very strong people. Their women are very strong. I feel if we give them time and they will assert their rights.","So when you see what's happening in Afghanistan, you must be pretty disgusted actually with the way that the Taliban are behaving.""Can I ask you now the other questions in Urdu? The relationship between Pakistan and India is really difficult at the moment, isn't it? Pakistan says that India must reverse Kashmir's special status. Is that realistic or unrealistic?","the problem here is, until India revokes the illegal change to the status of Kashmir in violation of United Nation Security CouncilÕs resolution, it is extremely difficult for Pakistan to establish relations with India. Until they restore the status of Kashmir, we canÕt talk with India. Only a plebiscite can decide the fate of the Kashmiris, according to the UNSC resolution.","Can I ask you now the other questions in Urdu? The relationship between Pakistan and India is really difficult at the moment, isn't it? Pakistan says that India must reverse Kashmir's special status. Is that realistic or unrealistic?""Prime minister, it's good to talk with you again. Hello. Thank you for taking the time.","Ex-, yes.","Prime minister, it's good to talk with you again. Hello. Thank you for taking the time."He was at his home in Lahore. He was still recovering from the leg wounds he suffered as he rode in the truck on November 3.,"I had three bullets in my right leg, and there were two shooters.

Though the economy suffered during his tenure, he says he can make it better.","The economy is sinking. The dollar earnings through remittances and exports - they're all going down. So basically, Pakistan is staring at default. Economy has tanked. And the sooner we get elections, a stable government comes in.

Why not accept that as the constitutional result? It is the system you have.","The problem, Steve, is that in Pakistan, unfortunately, parliamentary democracy is still evolving. So when you have a situation which is unheard of in maybe the Anglo-Saxon parliamentary democracies where you can actually buy the loyalties of of people - and I'm talking about 24 members of Parliament were sold. They sold themselves, and others were offered who refused. So that in itself means that the whole idea of democracy gets flawed.","I understand the long-term problem with corruption in Pakistan, but a majority of the parliament who were elected to those positions and some of whom were your allies voted no confidence.

Two different things. One, they were allies, but they also sold themselves. So we could have entered the auction and actually offered much more money to other people to buy on our side. But we decided on principle that this is not what we're going to do.","If you'll forgive me, though, these were not - were these not people who were your allies who were alleged to have been nudged in your direction once upon a time?""You mentioned the need for stability. Is it in the best interest of the country at this time to turn the focus on your cause and your protest, rather than focusing on the more immediate problems of the country and running in next year's election?","Well, if we wait till next year's election, our party is only getting stronger. As the government weakens, we are gaining aid from lack of economic performance. But the country is sinking. My only worry is that the one year which has left, the country might just be pushed to the point where it might go out of all our controls. I mean, it'd be impossible to pull it back.","You mentioned the need for stability.

How did your relationship with them go sour?","Well, look. The military is not something which all acts on, you know - they make a decision, the whole military acts. I'm specifically talking about this man who's in the intelligence agency. Whether the whole military had anything to do with it I don't know.

Well, Steve, let me for a start say that, look - the military in Pakistan is a reality. We became a security state 75 years ago or 74 years ago when we had a conflict with India. Still, the military was pretty predominant in our affairs. And that has to be for a while. But unfortunately, the situation in Pakistan right now is the only institution that is - that works, that is strong is the military. You know, it's the one institution that can actually - if the government works for them, you can bring them under the rule of law. The problem right now is that there is an imbalance. And that balance has to be there, because if a civilian government gets the responsibility of the vote from the people to run, it must also have the authority. And that balance is what needs to be reset.",Do you feel then that you do not have bad relations with the entire military or the military leadership at this point?"Do you believe you would be able to work with the military if you returned to power, given that you have accused at least one member of the military of plotting to kill you?","Well, you know, the military has its own good and bad.

It's about my country. So that - in that sense, I mean, it's all behind. So, you know, we have to move forward, and we have to have a new type of relationship with the U.S., which I've always said.

You took a huge number of people, a massive convoy, but they didn't get to where you were trying to go.","Well, the rally achieved its purpose. Basically it was to raise awareness in Pakistan -- well, there already is awareness in Pakistan. But outside Pakistan, there's drones, the drones are counterproductive. You don't kill your way to peace. There's 10 years of -- 11 years of war in Afghanistan, ages (ph) and Pakistan, what have we achieved? It's time to give peace a chance.","ÊImran, what was the point of the rally to the tribal areas, to Waziristan? You took a huge number of people, a massive convoy, but they didn't get to where you were trying to go.""How do you plan to do this, because, look, the drones are there, whether you agree with them or not, basically because the Pakistani military and the state have not been able to tackle these militants.","Christiane, everyone is sick of the militants. Everyone in Pakistan -- and I know, of course, in the U.S., they are tired of war. We are sick of militants and this war. Now the issue is how do we resolve it?","How do you plan to do this, because, look, the drones are there, whether you agree with them or not, basically because the Pakistani military and the state have not been able to tackle these militants.""So Imran, describe to me precisely, then, your strategy for winning them over, in other words, hearts and minds, winning them in a way that's not a military way.","ÊWell, Christiane, what I -- when we went to this rally, on the last border town of Waziristan, it's called Tank, we got the reception -- and they were -- we were received by the people of Waziristan. They got -- gave us this huge reception. The first time, someone had come to engage them. And I'm telling you this is the key to peace. Win the people over to your side. So what I would do is, first of all, I would call for a cease- fire. In Pakistan, I would say the army stops all operations and effort (ph). I would ask the U.S. not to do any drone attacks because they're counterproductive. Because what happens is Pakistan army, it seems like a collaborator of the U.S. So the militants target Pakistan army. And there's an unending chain of violence going on.

There's a Chinese proverb, ""Know your enemy."" Who are they? Since I -- my party, by the way, is by far the most popular party in Pakistan's tribal area, where the Taliban operate. So how would I deal with it? I -- first of all, because I know, look, the ideological Taliban -- you know, when you say they want to impose their system of sharia or their way of life, that's -- I can tell you that they're not more than 3 percent to 5 percent of the whole fighters. They're not more than 3 percent to 5 percent. The majority are either they are people who are reacting to Pakistan army, perceived as a mercenary army, and causing collateral damage, either they've gone that side or they have always -- this area has always resisted foreigners.","I hear you.

It'll sweep Pakistan because people want a change. They have seen all the parties over and over again. ","Imran, all of this presupposes that you become the next leader, the next prime minister. Clearly, that seems to be what you're aiming for.

That's how he'll win this insane war with billions and billions and trillions of dollars have been spent. What result has this war produced? I mean, over a trillion.

A lot of people are interested, at least in this neck of the woods, about whether it was shortsighted of you to blame the US, target the Americans after your ouster, considering how you and your party are now hoping for their support. The State Department has just recently called you a private citizen and said that itÕs not going to comment on your status. I see you smiling, interestingly, but do you think it was shortsighted to really tick off the Americans considering where you stand now regarding their support?","Well, letÕs just break it up. First of all, the facts. What happened? I get a cipherÑa cipher is this coded messageÑfrom my ambassador in Washington. He sends me this coded message, and now you tell me how should have I responded, I mean anyone, if they had got a message like that: prime minister of a country gets a message, an official meeting taking place between the undersecretary of state, US, and the Pakistan ambassador in Washington, and the message reads, hereÕs the prime minister reading the message that unless the Prime Minister, Imran Khan, is removed in a vote of no confidence, thereÕll be consequences for Pakistan. There were other things in the cipher, but I mean imagine a prime minister of a countryÑelected prime minister of a countryÑreads this message that an American official is telling my ambassador that Pakistan should get rid of me, otherwise thereÕll be consequences. So, I took this to the cabinet because I thought this was deeply insulting for a country of 250 million people. I thought it was humiliating for anyone to writeÉ Any official from any country writing a letter like that or sending a message like that to the prime ministerÑelected prime minister. Then I put it in front of the National Security Council, the National Security Council, which is headed by all the service chiefs, including the army chief. The National Security Council then gives a demarche to the US, protest that this is meddling in the internal affairs of Pakistan. But what happened was that after the cipher, the next day, the vote of [no] confidence is tabled in the National Assembly and within weeks my govern goes. So, I basically narrated the fact this is not anti-Americanism. This is a fact.","Well, letÕs start with that, letÕs start with the big picture and go to theÉ LetÕs time travel back to April 2022 when all of this started and begin with the so-called American connection with your ouster.

There was first, of course, the letter, then there wasnÕt a letter, then there was the cipher, which was then admonished by the ambassador himself: Asad Majeed Khan. Then there was the Donald Lu2Êconnection, the threat by Donald Lu, so to say. Then there was, of course, you premising all of this after the vote of confidence saying, ÒThis is because I didnÕtÉ I said, Ôabsolutely notÕ to their drone bases.Ó Then, of course, in all of this is compounded by you politicking, telling millions of Pakistanis almost on a nightly basis that thereÕs a clear American conspiracy for regime change, then comes the Haqqani connection where you said that, ÒHeÕs taken money and heÕs convinced all of Washington against me.Ó","Well, look, Wajahat, look, I used the word Òunfolded,Ó as things unfolded. At the time, this is first week of March, I received this cipher, and so I didnÕt immediately talk about the cipher because there was an OIC [Organization of Islamic Countries] conference in Pakistan and I didnÕt want this thing to break before the OIC conference, which was about 22nd or 23rd of March. And so therefore after that, on the 28th of March, I first disclosed this. And at that time, I was convinced thatÉ I mean, who would not be convinced reading that cipher? Who would not be convinced that the Americans are demanding that they get rid of the prime minister? I mean, what inference should I get from that? Clearly, it was clear. So, therefore, I did blame them that they were responsible. I never used the word Òbases,Ó I never used what reasons.","So premised on that, I understand itÕs a long arc, itÕs a long narrative, but they say that your positions have been inconsistent.

But again, in retrospect, was it shortsighted to have so much vitriol, so much venom, so much rhetoric on a daily basis, convincing millions of Pakistanis, angering them about the so-called American connection and thus alienating Washington, alienating the Biden administration, which today calls you a Òprivate citizenÓ and wonÕt back you up, even though clearly you need that backing.","Listen, Wajahat, I donÕt want any backing from anyone. Look, if the people of Pakistan decide that they want to elect me as the prime minister, fine. If they donÕt, I donÕt care. I mean, IÕve seen everything. IÕve been to the top. I mean, I have more love and respect in this country than anyone else, why would all the twelve parties together, including the military establishment, with one aim: somehow the whole policy is how to get rid of one man? The whole countryÕs democracy is being dismantled just to get rid of one man. So, I have more love and respect in this country. I donÕt care whether I become the prime minister or not. But the truth is that this is exactly what happened. How humiliating is it for a country? How come the US thinks of me as anti-American? Why donÕt they want to ask the question that how could their official make such an arrogant statement that a country shouldÉ an ambassador should give a message to get rid of the elected prime minister?","IÕm with you about the unfolding bit and especially that it went over months and that you adjusted your positions accordingly, Khan Sahib.

LetÕs go back to even further, forget last year. LetÕs go back to your career. LetÕs pivot to India. So, 2019, February, as you remember, there was a military escalation with India, Pakistan Air Force jets shot down Indian aircraft. You were praised globally in those tense, twenty-four, forty-eight hours for the stance you took against war. You deescalated what could have been a potential nuclear face-off between these two rivals. Again, IÕm going to say it on the record because it needs to be said, you were quite responsible in your statements and praised globally, even in India. However, eventually the criticism is that you missed an opportunity to establish long-term peace with India.","Look, I do not believe in settling issues through military action. I have always been anti-military settling of issues through war or through using arms. And this is not now. ItÕs been my view for three decades. Now, what happened was that when that happened, when the Pulwama [attack] happened and we returned the pilot [who was shot down], I mean, it was clear that it is unthinkable for two nuclear-armed countries to even think of escalation. I am worried about whatÕs happening in Ukraine right now and I worry that this could go out of hand. So as someone who is against nuclear arms and the idea of the world committing suicide through nuclear warÉSo what happened was that in [August] 2019, India took away the statehood of Kashmir unilaterally. I mean, I tried everything, but I came across this brick wall, and I realized itÕs something to do with the RSS-BJP mentality where theyÕve cashed in on hostility with Pakistan. ThatÕs all. But, frankly, it was never a question of being misled by anyone. And, Bajwa, I donÕt know what heÕs talking about because the idea which he was floating, it was that first India would give some concession, then we would invite them to Pakistan. The concession was that they would gradually take steps that would undo what they had done on 5th August. But that never happened. So, we had never moved forward. I donÕt know what he is talking about because Bajwa keeps shifting his positions.","All right, well, when you were not a private citizen, when you were PakistanÕs prime minister, you were praised.

You accepted during all of this, during this potential breakthrough, when there was a ceasefire in place, when there was a visit by Prime Minister Modi in the offing where you wouldÕve hosted him, if I mayÉ this is a Nobel Prize being presented to you and here you are as commerce minister, where you accept trade talks and then a few days later you reject your own trade talks.

What caused you to change your mind when you were almost there along with your chief in trying to repair ties, even convincing India to back off from Article 370?","Look, I donÕt remember the trade talks. All I know is that there was supposed to be a quid pro quo. India was supposed to give some concession, give some sort of a roadmap to Kashmir, and I was going to then host Prime Minister Modi in Pakistan. But it never materialized. So, it never went further than that. ThatÕs how it was.","So, what about the bit which your office did? Forget Bajwa.

PakistanÕs tanks are rusted, Pakistan doesnÕt have the fuel to provide its forces to fight a war, and thatÕs why peace with India is inevitable because Pakistan canÕt keep up. YouÕve seen this in recent news items. Did that intelligence, did that briefing from your chief of army staff ever come to your office? Did he ever consult you or confront you with this data?","Look, even if that was the case, for an army chief to make these statement is so ridiculous. What army chief makes these foolish statements even if it is the case? So, number one, yes, General Bajwa would make these statements, but I mean for an army chief, he is basically saying, ÒWe are just too weak.Ó You never make such a statement. But more to the point, who wants war with India? I mean, why would we want war with India? Why would anyone want to see a confrontation between the two countries? The thing is, like two civilized countries, we should solve our issues through dialogue, and if we canÕt solve them through dialogue, we just keep talking. But war is never an option. So, firstly, war is not an option. Secondly, for an army chief to keep saying that, I canÕt imagine an army chief saying such a stupid thing as that.","Speaking of that era as well, it was around the same time, now recent reports have emerged, that General Bajwa went public at that time, he said it privately, he said it to a bunch of journalists, that Pakistan has lost military parity with India.

Would you disclose, if you have a problem with another country, and our problem is Kashmir, would you make a statement like that if you are the army chief? No, you wouldnÕt say that. You would say, ÒWe are ready to defend our country.Ó Even if you canÕt, but you would say that.

He did not inform you of this lack of security preparedness vis--vis India?"ÊSo, moving on from India, letÕs pivot back to our friends and allies. Now, of course, you had very warm ties with regional leadership, with [Former Prime Minister of Malaysia] Mahathir, of course, with [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdo?an. YouÕve made a lot of friends especially in the OIC community. But two or three things. Firstly, they say that the moment Imran Khan lost the Americans was the day after the Taliban took over when he went to a hotel in Islamabad and said, ÒOh, the Afghans have broken the shackles of slavery.Ó I know that was rhetorical, youÕve commented on this before, but two days laterÉ your words were in theÊWall Street JournalÊand thatÕs how you were perceived. But moving beyond that, they also say here, there are assessments that you lost the confidence of the Chinese. You lost the confidence of the Saudis.","Well, first, the Americans. I mean, this thing was completely taken out of context. I was speaking in Urdu and then they translated it, and because the US was hurting at the time, that whole drama, which I actually donÕt blame President Biden, because how was he expected to know that three hundred thousand Afghan troops would give up without a fight? And so, it collapsed so quickly, and when President Ghani left Kabul, the whole thing collapsed so there was chaos. So, I could see that the US, they were in shock and awe of what happened. They were taken by complete surprise, and they didnÕt know how to react. So, I could see they were hurting, and this one comment would be misconstrued because I was talking about mental colonialism. They blamed me for going to Russia, for instance. Now, the Russian trip was organized by the foreign office. TheyÕd been asking for months for my trip to Russia. They wanted to mend the relationship and the army chief wanted me to go there, the service chiefs, because they wanted to buy hardware from Russia. So how would I know that I arrived in Russia and the next morning they invaded Ukraine? I mean, how was I supposed to know? That was held against me.","ÊSo, moving on from India, letÕs pivot back to our friends and allies.

Because my government, the vote of [no] confidence came on the 7th or 8th of March. On the 20th or 21st of March, this was the second time Pakistan hosted a foreign ministerÕs OIC meetingÑsecond time in four months. Before that, it was fourteen or fifteen years ago Pakistan had hosted a meeting. A meeting of the OIC cannot take place without the SaudisÕ agreement. So why would they agree to, just before IÕm leaving power in two months, three months, two OIC meetings? And, secondly, the Chinese foreign minister came as a special guest. Why would he come if the Chinese were not happy? So, this whole myth that I had upset, who was behind this? Guess who was promoting these myths? Because compare the foreign policy in my time to what is happening right now, Pakistan today is totally isolated. I mean, it doesnÕt even feature anywhere. In our time, Pakistan was being taken seriously. And IÕm telling you, this relationship between Iran and Saudi, on behest of MBS, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, I went to Iran to speak to them. Remember, there were tensions at the timeÑsome missile attack had taken placeÑso the Saudi prince sent me to Iran and he wanted me to bring down the tensions. And so I played my part. And even on Yemen, I mean, Yemen, we tried to end this war and play our role in it and this is because the Saudis and the Iranians asked us. So, this idea that we were isolated and I had upset friends is just total nonsense.","ÊI mean, it was a pretty tenuous time.""Right. Well, thanks for that. But the reports about your reservations about CPEC [China Pakistan Economic Corridor] precede all of this. They go way back.

I mean, unless it is your country, which you donÕt have good relationship with. So, the US would talk about Hong Kong or Uyghurs. But I mean India, when they clearly violated international law in Kashmir and put them in a open prison, they basically put a curfew in Kashmir. I mean, did any of the big power, Western power, criticize India for it? No. No one said anything.

And yet he gives a man of, well, limited reputation an extension, then allows his rival, Nawaz Sharif, his lifelong rival, to leave even though you came in on the platform of justice.","So let me clarify. We had just come in, I was due and the army as an institution is the only institution that works in Pakistan because itÕs intact. All other institutions when I took power were in a terrible condition. I mean, they had been tampered with, politicized, they werenÕt working properly. So, if you wanted things done, you got it done through the Army. I mean, IÕm talking about, say for instance, COVID-19. We wanted logistics support. We wanted the whole country toÑdata from all the hospitals. IÕm just giving an example. And the best way we could do was the army. It would immediately get us all the data. So, in that sense, so it worked. It worked. We did well in the beginning. The only problem is after the extension what happened, there was a different General Bajwa. And so the problem, what I faced with them is that my whole platform was bringing the powerful under the law. So, rule of law is what I started off with twenty-seven years back. And when I tried to bring the powerful under the law, I discovered that unless General Bajwa wanted it, I couldnÕt do it. So because NAB, the [national] accountability bureau was controlled by him. So, we had no control over what was going on. All these guys who are now in the government, they would blame me for their corruption cases. But we inherited all the corruption cases.","IÕd really like to hear it KhanÉ because this story is the story of our country at this point. IsnÕt it?

Because we had two years of COVID everywhere the world, the impact of COVID-19 and the commodity super cycle. So, the whole concentration was there. And so as far as the economy went, we did the best economic performance in the last seventeen years. Our last two years we grew at almost 6 percent.

And he is the one who pulled the rug [from] under my feet.",DidnÕt you let the fox into the house?"But IÕm personally shocked that for a man who used to threaten to walk away from his own team, if he wasnÕt allowed to pick it, if he wasnÕt allowed to literally pick his own men in his own cricket squadÑtheyÕve written about this; you have written about thisÑsomeone who is so adamant about control, about his vision, about his strategy when itÕs interfered with is now saying that he was new, he was inexperienced.

Bringing the powerful under the law, which has never happened in PakistanÕs history before. The powerful are above law and the masses have no access to justice. So that was my main theme. I discovered that unless you have a powerful mandate by the public, the public must give you a strong mandate. You must have a strong government. Only then can you implement your reform program. Unfortunately, I had a weak coalition government. So, the moment I used to go after the powerful, the problem used to be to keep my majority intact. And we could only keep our majority intact by telling the army, the ISI, look, you must make sure that they come, my members appear for voting.","But IÕm personally shocked that for a man who used to threaten to walk away from his own team, if he wasnÕt allowed to pick it, if he wasnÕt allowed to literally pick his own men in his own cricket squadÑtheyÕve written about this; you have written about thisÑsomeone who is so adamant about control, about his vision, about his strategy when itÕs interfered with is now saying that he was new, he was inexperienced.

And currently I see the PTIÕs flag right behind you. And the PTI is a shadow today of what it was just a few weeks ago. People have left in droves.

Or does that say something about the weak structure of the PTI?","Let me, let me first tell you exactly what happened because I was in the opposition in 2002. The entire PML-N became PML-Q. So, there were only ten members left. What are you talking about there? Nawaz Sharif was left by his entire party, which formed government under PML-Q. So, I mean, IÕm just correcting you.","So, speaking of current affairs, coalitions, electoral politics, Khan Sahib, leadership is the undergirding of all of this.

There were five or ten people who went to jail this time. I mean, what people have gone through now, theyÕve been thrown in jails and theyÕve been shut in these cells with a lot of people and dead cells. I mean, their businesses have been destroyed. TheyÕve been warned. I mean their families have been threatened. This has never happened in this country before. The way they have been making people leave my party, itÕs unprecedented. But Wajahat, today PTI is stronger than ever in its history. PTI today is the strongest party in PakistanÕs history. Why? Because PTI has the biggest vote bank. It doesnÕt matter if people leave you. If ÒelectablesÓ leave you, it doesnÕt matter. IÕll just give you an example of Punjab. We gave almost four hundred tickets in the Punjab election. Punjab is 60 percent PakistanÕs population. So I gave four hundred tickets. Only forty people have left. And do you know what about the rest? TheyÕre all hiding. None of them are staying in their houses. Their houses are broken in, the relatives are picked up, their businesses are shut. And yet out of four hundred, only forty people have left. Why arenÕt they leaving? Because they all realize that the moment they leave the party, itÕs the end of their politics. Because the people in this country have never stood with any party as they stand with PTI today. Which is why you have the whole government machinery, the whole intelligence agencies, all institutions [have] one-point agenda somehow to dismantle PTI. And theyÕre failing because the vote bank is growing rather than the vote bank shrinking. The vote bank of PTI is growing, which is why people are not leaving us.","They went through a couple of years of jail, some of them, not like a couple of weeks.""But Khan-Saab, theyÕre saying you tried to trigger a coup. TheyÕre saying youÕve been in touch with the former army officers. They were saying you tried to divide the ranks of the worldÕs fifth-largest military. Which begs the question, have you been in touch with, for example, General Faiz? I know you were in touch with General Bajwa even after your ouster, and you said so accordingly. Which surprises me, by the way. The same man who kicks you out, you end up trying to negotiate with him. But are you in touch with General Faiz? Have you been in touch with military brass? Because thatÕs what they say. They say, ÒThis man is trouble and he thinks the rules donÕt apply to him. And his party tweets, that heÕs a red line. Why canÕt he turn up to court like everybody else has since Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Pakistani or Indian Muslim leaders have suffered court cases and have gone to jail. WhatÕs so special about Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi?Ó ThatÕs what they say.","SpecialÉ? I have 160 court cases, 160 cases against me, and I do nothing but most of my time is going from one court to the other to get bail. Tomorrow again, nineteen cases tomorrow, IÕm trying to get bail. nineteen cases. ItÕs never happened in our history before. No political leader has ever hadÉ At the age of seventy, he does not have one criminal case. And suddenly in the last few months, he has 170 cases, 160 cases. People have known me for fifty years. TheyÕve just slapped a murder case on me. People know me. So, I repeat. The only time I couldnÕt go to attend the courts was when I was shot and I was housebound and they knew about it. They knew my reports. I had my leg broken, so therefore I couldnÕt attend. But since IÕve been recovered, I attend every case. The countryÕs going down, we are heading towards default. We already have 38 percent inflation. We are heading towards hyperinflation. So, my talks with only for the country and trying to make him understand that unless you have elections, you will not have political stability. General Faiz, I might have spoken to him three times since I left government and since he was not the army chiefÉI mean the ISI chief. This is all nonsense. TheyÕre just trying to get rid of me because for some reason the current army chief has decided that whatever happens, I cannot come into power. So, theyÕre throwing all these things on me. I mean, I go to beÉ army court. These military courts. The reason why these military courts have been set up is to try me because in civil courts thereÕs no way any of these bogus cases can throw me in jail. So thatÕs why all this is going on. These conspiracy theories, I donÕt know anyone in the army. I donÕt know any of the generals. I had no business for them. It was not my job to knowÑexcept the ones I was dealing with.

You-last","Last question please, Wajahat. I have to go. ItÕs eleven oÕclock.","Khan-Saab, about the current army chief. You singled him out after you were released from prison. You-last""Sure, Khan-Saab. Thank you. So, then IÕll compound this question with another question. IÕll give you one and a half questions. One, you singled out the army chief. You said, ÒItÕs not about the army, itÕs about one man.Ó WhatÕs the problem here with him? Was it because you sacked him when you were prime minister, when he was ISI Chief. Does it go back to that episode? ThatÕs question number one. WhatÕs the beef here between you and General Asim Munir? IÕd like to know, because youÕve said that thereÕs beef, so thatÕs question one. And then question two, Khan-Saab before I let you go. What would you do differently? What would you do differently if you were in a time machine today, and you were allowed to go back to August 2018. What would Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi do differently?","Firstly, itÕs not about me or General Asim. ItÕs about Pakistan. I mean, I have no personal thing against him. He clearly has something, I donÕt know, which is why I offered to meet and hold dialogue and not now, since he came to power, since he became the army chief, I have been since then saying that, look, itÕs about Pakistan, itÕs not about us. So, I need to understand why this whole country isÉ ÒThereÕs only one mission, get rid of Imran. He should not come into power.Ó So, what alternative have they got? I mean, maybe he can convince me that IÕm so bad for the country, but there is some other plan which will be good for the country. At the moment, there is no other plan. ThereÕs only one plan. So thatÕs why I wanted to meet him. And remember, itÕs not about us. ItÕs not whether I like him or he likes me. ItÕs about the country. And the country is going down rapidly. People are losing hope in the country. Almost a million professionals, quality people, have left the country in the last few months. ThereÕs a flight of capital. So thatÕs my point.","Sure, Khan-Saab. Thank you. So, then IÕll compound this question with another question. IÕll give you one and a half questions. One, you singled out the army chief. You said, ÒItÕs not about the army, itÕs about one man.Ó WhatÕs the problem here with him? Was it because you sacked him when you were prime minister, when he was ISI Chief.

What would Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi do differently?""But I must interject. Why did you fire him when he was ISI chief, Khan Sahib? What happened?","ÊWell, there were issues. I had issues with him and so therefore I couldnÕt work with him. But thatÕs in the past. I have no issue with him. So, I think right now itÕs not about personal likes and dislikes. ItÕs about the country. Now, secondly, if I had to go back again to 2018, I wouldÕve called for elections. I wouldÕve dissolved the parliament and gone for general elections again and only taken power","But I must interject. Why did you fire him when he was ISI chief, Khan Sahib? What happened?""When you were asked for an extension, at that point, when would you have asked for elections again, IÕm just trying to figure out","No, straightforward, straightaway. I mean, had I known how difficult it was to implement your programÉ We inherited the biggest current account deficit in our history. So, the country was bankrupt. So, we inherited two big deficits, the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit. So, the economy was in shambles, and we were the first time in government. And here I had this ambitious program of rule of law to bringing the mafias under control. There was no way I could have done it with a coalition government with a thin majority. It was just not possible. So, with hindsight, I should have immediately called for elections and only taken government if I had a substantial majority.","When you were asked for an extension, at that point, when would you have asked for elections again, IÕm just trying to figure out""And moving on this week, you are faced with a lot of court charges. YouÕre going to Islamabad, youÕre going to Baluchistan, a sensitive area, an insecure area. Do you still fear that you might be targeted, your life might be targeted, Imran Khan?","Yes, I do. Well, the government, I mean the interior minister has said my life is a danger. I mean, he said from foreign agencies, but, actually, itÕs the government itself who wereÉ I mean there were two assassination attempts on me. One was on the 3rd of November last year. One was on 18th of March in Islamabad. So, will there be another one? I think thereÕs a strong possibility because they would imagine that even if I am put in jail, which I just know that in the next two weeks theyÕll find somewhere to put me in jail. So, they would worry that even if IÕm in jail, my party would still win. So, I think theyÕd be thinking of the final solution. So mentally, IÕm prepared","And moving on this week, you are faced with a lot of court charges. YouÕre going to Islamabad, youÕre going to Baluchistan, a sensitive area, an insecure area. Do you still fear that you might be targeted, your life might be targeted, Imran Khan?""Imran, did you just say that youÕre mentally prepared to be killed? Is that what you just said to me?","No, IÕm mentally prepared that anything could happen. I mean, someone whoÕs faced two assassination attempts is going to be prepared that thereÕs a possibility because the same reasons, the reasons are still there when they tried to kill me twice before. The reason is that the partyÕs popular will win the next election. So, as long as that reason is there, they could try again. So, in that sense, mentally, I mean I have overcome the fear of dying. I feel that I should be prepared for everything. But jail, I know in the next two weeks theyÕll put me in jail because thereÕs so many cases. All they have to do is cancel one bail and IÕll be inside.","Imran, did you just say that youÕre mentally prepared to be killed? Is that what you just said to me?""Joining me tonight is a man who is currently rewriting all the rules of politics in Pakistan. The man, who is currently the country's most popular political leader according to recent polls, Imran Khan. Imran Khan, thanks very much for joining me tonight. Imran you could conceivably return to India as the next Prime Minister of Pakistan.","I think we have, my party's poised, in fact I will go a step further, unless we make blunders nothing can stop the party from winning. Because the young people in Pakistan, which is the majority, have decided on a change, so therefore they have identified Tehreek-e-Insaaf, PTI my party, for change. Now unless we, the image of the candidate does not suit the image of the party which is for change, is the only way we will not win.","Joining me tonight is a man who is currently rewriting all the rules of politics in Pakistan.

Do you see similarities in the two very different struggles the countries are facing?","Remember corruption is what makes the third world. If you look at Transparency International, this NGO, which publishes every year the table for the most corrupt government and the cleanest government, and if you look at the table, the most prosperous countries are the least corrupt and the best government, and the poorest countries are the most corrupt ones. So it's got nothing to do with your resources. Corruption destroys a country, it destroys the government system and when the government system goes it doesn't matter if you are sitting on oil like Nigeria, you still have masses of poor people.","ÊIt's interesting as you mentioned corruption, and this has been really a main mantra really of your party, or election campaign is anti-corruption, India is going through similar, in the sense, where ruling government is battling with the same allegations of corruption and the Opposition is also facing similar allegations.

The Army can step in any time. The late Brijesh Mishra told me does VK Singh think that he is in the Pakistan, when there was tension between him and the ruling government. From the Pakistani perspective how do you see that take?","Well I'm afraid and it's sad to say, but to some extent it's right. Pakistan's democratic system never got going. Each time when the political government trounced, the Army in our democratic system didn't involve India. On the other hand the democracy got embedded, narrowed, stayed there for a long time. So the system flourished and our Pakistan great leader Qaid-e-Aazam died immediately after partition, after independence, so they did not have the leader of stature, so hence we are stuck with the musical chairs. Politicians filling, Army coming back, and the fact it was Army rule. We never had politicians who came and would be nurtured by the Army so natural leadership never evolved. But now we are in an incredible situation. For the first time you are seeing, in the worst of times and the best of times, we are actually seeing a general democracy about to explode.","But often and Indian politicians often pride themselves with the fact that look, at least India is not like Pakistan, they would claim that our democracy is a success story, look at what is happening in Pakistan, they have no real democracy.

From the Pakistani perspective how do you see that take?""And you don't think the Army, the establishment can stop that, in the sense because people accused you to be more close to the Army?","Well the ones who accused me was this party PMLN, and lo and behold there was this famous case by Azhar Khan, which was in the Supreme Court, where the ISI has funded some politician's party, and guess which party they have funded, PMLN, who have accused me of being funded by the party. So you know what they say, it takes a thief to catch a thief, because the thief they think is similar. He thinks he knows everyone, he knows how the thief thinks. So they thought we were also were backed by the ISI. But no one has understood this phenomenon, this massive change, which started at the ground level and then suddenly exploded in this massive public rally. It's actually a politically aware public thanks to this electronic media, which is vibrant. For the first time we have television with chat shows, you have the prime time television, political current affair programmes and secondly the social media amongst the young people, like in the Arab Spring. It caused such political awareness that now you are seeing a completely new Pakistan, and the old politician can't come to terms with it because they are still stuck in the time warp.","And you don't think the Army, the establishment can stop that, in the sense because people accused you to be more close to the Army?""It's interesting because when you use age in that sense, Bilawal Bhutto is a very young President of the Pakistan People's Party, you don't think he will more naturally appeal to the youth than you?","Bilawal has hardly spent any time in Pakistan; he can barely speak Urdu. He does not know Pakistan. He has inherited a party on a piece of a paper. An 18 year old being made Co-chairperson of a party, it violates all democratic norms so it's exactly against we all are fighting for. We wanted genuine democracy. This is actually more like a monarchy. In fact Prince Charles will be better equipped to take on after the Queen than say Bilawal after Benazir.","It's interesting because when you use age in that sense, Bilawal Bhutto is a very young President of the Pakistan People's Party, you don't think he will more naturally appeal to the youth than you?"Dynasty is the reality in the sub-continental politics.,"It violates the basis of democracy you see. Why did democracy come in, because basically monarchy degenerated; just because one king is exceptionally talented or he struggled in life and he has achieved great things doesn't mean the son is going to do the same. What makes a leader? He comes through the struggle. It's the struggle that develops the leader, where he can stand pressure. The greatest quality of the leader he can take pressure in crisis; he stands like a Churchill did once; so if a leader has not faced pressure in his life, he has led a life full of comfort, how can he be suddenly handed the country's destiny? Just to give you an example both Benazir and Nawab Sharif, the reason why they failed, one of the reasons why they failed, their first job is to be a Prime Minister. They have never done anything in their life and how can you be a leader if you have never done anything in your life.",Dynasty is the reality in the sub-continental politics."But in that sense people would say you are cricketer and you went into social work and charity. You've been in politics but not that successfully as in the last decade, what equips you?","Well number one I built an institution. You see a country is all about building institution, strengthening institutions, seeing how they work. So I built the best institution in Pakistan and in the last three years it's consistently won awards for the best managed non-corporate institution in Pakistan. I have built a university. Now the first university out in rural areas, but I mean compared to me hardly any politician has ever done anything. Even as a cricketer at least I achieved, I competed. These guys have done nothing. They didn't have a job in their life. Most of them have not done a job in their lives. So how do you expect them to run a country? If you do not understand how to run an institution you cannot run a country.","But in that sense people would say you are cricketer and you went into social work and charity. You've been in politics but not that successfully as in the last decade, what equips you?""Well Imran, as you said those who have laughed you are I think, now are eating their words in many senses. I have some questions. As I said a man who is a potential Prime Minister of Pakistan, former Chief Minister of J&K and Cabinet Minister Farooq Abdullah has this question to ask you.  Imran if you come to power in Pakistan what steps you would take to improve relationships between India and Pakistan? Also will you bring those people responsible for crime in Mumbai to book, so that people in the subcontinent realise that you mean business when you say you want to fight terror?","ÊMy friend Farooq, all I can say to him is that my Party has taken a decision that it's time now to have a completely new relation with India. And I hope you know the Indian, certainly the Indian public realises, the young people in India realise that the dividend of peace, the so enormous, I mean if we have peace, this China, the fastest growing economy on one side of Pakistan is the whole, the greatest resource of energy; on the other side of Pakistan India, one of the biggest economies on the other side; I mean if we have peace this could be the fastest growing place in the world, the happening place in the world. The mere fact that we have not been able to sort out our relations and we have this mistrust and we blame each other for everything, Pakistan blames India and Baluchistan Mumbai, and other things. India blames Pakistan, this mistrust we have to have a new relationship. This is my conviction. I'm not making any political statement. I'm not going to get votes in India, but yes, this is my conviction it's time to look ahead in the larger picture. And so that's number one. Number two when he talks about of bringing those criminals of Mumbai to justice it's my conviction that time has come in Pakistan that we should. When we treat terrorism as the whole, because I remember Pakistan is the one who is suffering from terrorism the most, we have lost around fifty thousand people in terrorist attacks; so the time has come now again for Pakistan to completely review the way we have dealt with the militant groups in our country, because it is now having an impact. Pakistan can't go on as it is, and I'm not saying a group, which India is worried about groups; I'm talking about groups within operating within Pakistan, Karachi for instance, the three major parties patronized the militant group. Karachi is up in flames. Businesses are leaving. Karachi is our financial hub. Every day there are about 10 to 15 people targeted, killed in Karachi. So a country just cannot go as it is. So therefore first we intend to pull out of this US war and terror that will take with it a narrative jihad from the militants. The moment the jihad from the militants are taken away we mobilise our tribal people to reclaim the tribal area, because the only reason they do not take on the militants is because they do not fight a mujahedeen. They are very conservative and religious people. The moment the jihad narrative goes, the moment we disengage from the US war, won't allow any drone attacks, won't take any money from the US, and then we ask the tribal people to reclaim the land and they will easily do it. About 8-900 thousand armed tribals, as opposed to 20 -30 thousand militants. So they reclaim the land and then return inwards and deal with all the sort of militant groups, some nurtured by us during the Afghan jihad in the '80s, just Pakistan has to deal with them and weaponise them.","Well Imran, as you said those who have laughed you are I think, now are eating their words in many senses. I have some questions. As I said a man who is a potential Prime Minister of Pakistan, former Chief Minister of J&K and Cabinet Minister Farooq Abdullah has this question to ask you.

On these specific individuals, what is your stand?","We take names of them and passing judgment on them because India feels them as terrorists, this is not the way to go about. I would be someone who believes in the rule of law. We would insist that anyone who indulges in terrorist attacks in Pakistan, or outside, must be brought to justice in the Pakistan courts. Lots of terrorists haven't been brought to justice. Most of the people who are involved in 40 thousand, 50 thousand people killed through terrorism haven't been brought to justice. Not even sectarian terrorists have been brought to justice. The other day about 29 Shias were pulled out of buses and shot in the head. We haven't caught those guys. Therefore we need to strengthen the rule of law and we need to strengthen the prosecution. We need to strengthen the justice system, but before all that we need to pull out of the US war, because what is complicating things for Pakistan is because Pakistan Army and Security Forces are perceived as mercenary army of the US. They have declared jihad on Pakistan. So the security agencies are protecting themselves. So how can they protect the people? So once you pull out you deal with the various groups. So if you strengthen your justice system, I think we will eventually get a control over all these. So who is responsible for attacks on India, attacks in Pakistan or outside should be brought to justice because Pakistan cannot go on as it is.","ÊBut in that sense till Pakistan achieves this, which could well be a long term solution, for India the two red flags that remain of Hafeez Sayeed who we consider to be the master mind behind the attacks is roaming free in Pakistan and also Dawood Ibrahim, who the Home Minister said again, is in safe haven in Pakistan. On these specific individuals, what is your stand?"Do you accept the Indian narrative that Pakistan is not doing enough to tackle cross border terror and it is an example of what you have cited. Would you accept that narrative?,"There is hardly any cross border terrorism now. I don't think India has talked about the cross border terrorism in Kashmir. Only sticking point is the Mumbai thing. I think the Indians should not pressurise the Pakistan Government to take any extra judicial steps. Because remember you create the martyrs, the more you follow the law, the more you de-mystify criminals, the more you create this extra judicial stuff, they become martyrs. I always compare Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein went through the deep process of law, hardly anyone talks about Saddam Hussein. Osama from the day, the way he was shot dead he has become a cult with certain groups.

Would you accept that narrative?"The worry in India remains the role of the ISI. Our perception would be that ISI will still see India as the enemy number one; in that sense we aren't talking about, as the former Home Minister Mr Chidambaram said, state players, when we, India, talk about state players. Do you accept perhaps there's some truth there?","What has happened in the past, obviously India has its suspicions. Pakistan has its. Don't forget that whenever there's something in Pakistan they blame RAW for it, so both the governments blame each other. I am talking about new relationship. I think this is all about past, that the idea is to move forward. ISI is part of the Pakistan's Army it's not going to act independently in Pakistan. I think the Pakistan Army too now wants a difference the way Pakistan is being governed. It has to be governed the way it has never been governed before. And I think the army accepts it because the country is facing crisis of mammoth proportions now. I mean we are looking at facing bankruptcy. And I think they will back a government, which can do whatever it can do to fix the governance system and somehow make Pakistan solvent.","The worry in India remains the role of the ISI.

SirÊagar aapkoÊchanceÊmile toh kya aapÊKashmirÊayenge?","ÊI would love to go to Kashmir, because my mother always used to spend her summer holidays on a houseboat in Kashmir as a young girl. My grandfather would take all our family there, and so we always have these, growing up we were always told these stories. So the Kashmir thing is, simultaneously we should have talks on Kashmir and simultaneously we should open up trade with each other, open up our borders, visa restrictions, cricket matches, so the two should go together. If you concentrate on one and not Kashmir, you will always have the chances of some militants doing the Mumbai attack thing. So do the two together and then Kashmir is solvable. I have three in the party, ex foreign ministers. All three of them tell me that they came very close to Kashmir solution, specially in times of Vajpayee. So it is possible and therefore resume talks on Kashmir. And I think what India can do as confidence building measure is reduce the Army there. Remember Army is no answer to anything. Army is like treating cancer with disprin, it's a temporary solution, it is not a permanent solution. So in Pakistan military adventures in FATA have failed, in Baluchistan have failed; in East Pakistan long ago have failed. Similarly India keeping its 600-700 thousand troops in the valley, it's not going to work, it is going to alienate people more. So they should start that. We shouldn't show that there isn't militancy from Pakistan. And then we should start talks there. And, eventually come to some sort of solution because nothing is impossible.","Salaam alekumÊImran Sir, this is Behraan from Kashmir.

You still have raised an issue of the perception of jihad and in a way blaming the government. The Afghanistan government attacked and took it strongly after you made that statement that you are too close to the Taliban. How you will answer that?","ÊAll I told them was, and this is in context of Jihad, that if Pakistan disengages from the Americans it will cease to be a jihad in Pakistan. And therefore once there is no jihad the fanaticism, the suicide bombers go, we can take care of the rest. And Afghanistan, it doesn't matter what Imran Khan thinks, it's the people fighting against the native forces as long as they think jihad is jihad. How do you tell Gubuddin Hekmatayr, when he was fighting against Soviets, the Soviet Occupation, it was jihad, and Ronald Regan greets him as Mujahiddin and a hero; now he's fighting the American occupation, it's not jihad. So in Afghanistan all I was pointing out was it's those who are fighting against calling it jihad. And it's in the context of taking the jihad narrative away from the Pakistan side. It wasn't there to upset the Afghanistan government. It was just stating a fact. What do the Taliban, who fight or the fighters fighting NATO think, would you think they would be having suicide attacks or all of their attacks if they didn't think it's jihad?","You have been accused, sometimes people call you Taliban Khan and even after you visited 14-year-old Malala who had been shot.

I am the only person in a political party that has given a solution. No one has given any solution, everyone else is saying more of the same, everyone's following Einstein's definition of madness, doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. What are they doing different? Eight and a half years of this madness, we are not winning the war we won't win this in next 10 years. I am the only one giving the three point agenda how to win it. Now when you disengage I am telling you about how to deal with Taliban and the fanaticism. Malala is a case of the fanaticism and I mean the insanity that someone could shoot a 14 yr old girl. I am the first one who went there, I am the first one who openly condemned the Taliban, the other political leaders Zardari and Nawaz Sharif didn't name the Taliban, and I condemned them. But somehow because I talk about political solutions, it's this bush doctrine, either you're with us or against us. So if you are anti-military operations, you must be pro-Taliban, it's a stupid as that. I mean...","ÊNow in that sense I know you did condemn strongly, but the shooting of a 14-year-old girl?

How would you ensure that Malalas can go to school?","ÊBecause the moment you win the war against this militancy, you will be able to restore the schools back again. It's this fanaticism stemming out of this insane war, which is actually radicalising our society more, which is producing these fanatics. There was an article by someone of the best American minds, which I thought wrote one of the best perceptive articles, Graham Fuller, the ex-Chief of the CIA station of Afghanistan in Kabul. He wrote this article five years ago saying exactly the same thing. He said until we keep pushing Pakistan to do more, Pakistan is empowering the frenzy of fanaticism. The moment we leave Afghanistan, Pakistan's security forces will be able to control the extremists.","How would you assure girls' education, girls' right to be educated freely?

What do you hope will actually change now, because so far America hasn't been receptive to your theories at all, in fact you had the recent incident when you were detained at Toronto.","Well the point is that the drone attacks link Pakistan to the American war, and when they link us together that means we cannot, you mean we cannot take the narrative Jihad away from the militants, because Pakistan Army is killing the same people as the Americans. We are killing the same people, so we are the enemy of the Taliban. And therefore jihad, if it's against the Americans occupying force it's also against us as collaborators. So therefore I have always maintained you know that these drone attacks are completely counterproductive, apart from all humanitarian laws. No law allows someone to be judged then executed and eliminate suspects, remember these are suspects. We don't know whether actually they are militants. Suspects, if their wives and children anyone there is eliminated. I mean this is barbaric, and it's even descending lower than the level of what Taliban are doing, and all it's doing is creating anti Americanism. And it's counterproductive in the sense that militants are quickly replaced. Whoever is killed is replaced, and according to the Stanford University report, 98% of those who are killed either are low level militants or the innocent civilians, only 2% are high level targets. So what are they achieving, what are the drone attacks achieving?","You just came up as Obama is re-elected for another four years, you have been a strong critic of his administration for those drone attacks.

He will be no longer under pressure. And he will follow his instincts, which is he's basically a man of peace. As appears in this book Obama's War that he was always anti the search whether as the general persuader or general patriot.

The reason he knows I used to bowl bouncers at the other guy, because whenever he used to play with me, because when I was younger, I was a boy who came to a cricket team, Sadeeq gave me a tough time. He used to make fun of me, he used to; he used to ridicule me saying I would never succeed. I remember once I was, I don't remember I was 18, I wasn't very good, I mean he was right. So they made me field this position, where silly short leg without a helmet or anything, where I could be hit. And so when I was fielding there they could see I was nervous, and Sadeeq went and said, it doesn't matter you put him there, you know he's never going to play cricket any way.

We are stuck in the past. It's time to move on. Yes we do not allow any terrorism from our soil, yes we should have two governments that have confidence that we are trying our best help each other, rather than making it difficult for each other. Let us help each other to have a strong relationship. Relationships are nurtured you know, they are never one sided that you know, you have to do this, you come to my standard and then I'll talk to you. This is nonsense. This is immature.

But I must say one thing that India Pakistan match, if the governments are moving closer, if the whole atmosphere is of peace, then it becomes healthy, a healthy competition. But that anger, that, what's the word, that nastiness goes out of here, but if the relationship isn't good then this anger, like I have played twice when we were getting closer, it was incredible, the sort of feeling in India, you know the warmth and everything. The next time I had played, our forces were at the border for 1987, and I felt a lot of animosity in the cricket field from the crowd.

When the biggest blunder made by George Bush and Tony Blair was that they declared war against radical Islam. Now what should have happened, in my opinion, is that there were 19 criminals. They should have treated like criminals, they shouldn't have been elevated to the status of holy warriors, because the moment Islam comes in there would be the moment they become the warriors of Islam. There were plenty of people to emulate them. Every human community has its fanatics, so I felt that the way the whole war was fought was deeply flawed. Islam should never have made the part of it. It is not the war against ideologies, which is what they made it out to be. This is not ideology, some ideological war like Communism, like Nazism. It was almost deliberate. They wanted to create an enemy. This war, all its root cause was political, and politics was in case of 9/11, was the Palestinian-Israel issue, that's what caused that.","I have a question also from a viewer who wrote in our website NDTV.com and they asked that how can Muslims, going beyond stereotypes both in Pakistan and India, there in a sense is a stereotypical view in both India and Pakistan, how do they combat that image?""Do you find that as Muslim politician, who believes in Islam, the buttonhold into certain pockets, you know the people will say Imran Khan is a Muslim politician, ergo he is a fundamentalist, ergo he supports the radical mullahs?","Well, the problem is that ever since the Iranian revolution the West, the Americans, look upon the Muslim society as some sort of fight going on between Muslim fundamentalist and some moderates. This is the narrative they have put the Muslim world in, see in India they look upon us just the same. Actually this is not the issue in the Muslim world, it is between the status quo and anti -status quo. Hence when the Arab Spring took place everyone kept wondering where are the fundamentalists and where are the moderates. Actually everyone was together against a corrupt status quo, same thing in Pakistan. My political party basically is what the Arab Spring is all about. We have all sorts of people with us, we have right wing, we have madrasa students; we have English-medium students. People wanted change. Democratic rights. So, because this strange narrative has been imposed upon me, on one side I am called by the so-called Western liberals, who basically I call 'westoxified', whatever the West says they parrot it in Pakistan. They call me Taliban Khan or some sort of fundamentalist and so on, On the other hand the Taliban called me Western liberal secular and pro American, so I am stuck between these two extremes. Because they don't understand the real issue of Pakistan, which is a small corrupt status quo, a ruling elite, which is hogging all the resources of the country, as opposed to the majority of Pakistan, who want change and a genuine democracy.","Do you find that as Muslim politician, who believes in Islam, the buttonhold into certain pockets, you know the people will say Imran Khan is a Muslim politician, ergo he is a fundamentalist, ergo he supports the radical mullahs?""ÊBut with one common issue, where politicians say in India and perhaps in Pakistan as well, that in India where perhaps the quest is for the vote bank; that certain politicians will not speak up against even the most fundamentalist tenets of either Hinduism or Islam, because the vote banks are catering toÊ","I was told that I did not criticise Taliban and the Malala incident.

And I am sad to say that yes, there was injustice. But remember there is no rule of law in Pakistan. When rule of law collapses, anyone who is from the weaker section of the society suffers. Laws are to protect the weak from the strong. But it is not specifically community based, because Raymond Davies who was an American CIA, in broad day light shoots two Pakistani teenagers in front of everyone, in a crowded street, he is taken out of Pakistan, he is above law. A Pakistan law could not do anything. So, if you are strong, no matter which religion you are from, you can get away with anything. Murder. But if you are weak, you have no power. That is why my party is called Tehreek-e-Insaaf, movement for justice. We need rule of law in Pakistan, rule of law is what will protect minorities and I am sad to say that in Sindh where the law has absolutely collapsed. I mean if you look at Karachi, everyday there are target killings going on, no one is caught.

LetÕs get to the elephant in the room, Snap, you helped it go public at $17, itÕs now trading at $6 and change. I know that you helped grow revenue, and do a lot of things there. Clearly thereÕs still a lot to do, and markets donÕt think it was enough, so why leave when you did, which was just a few weeks ago?""Then what are you seeing, that the market is not seeing? Why doesnÕt the market seem to believe in that innovation, and all the things that you put in place? What are they missing about Snap?","I think, you know, Snap has to execute in terms of some of the newer product innovation, you know, I think, this year, obviously, the redesign, and some of the things, there were some hiccups, and I think they need to show that they can continue to innovate the way they did in the past.","Then what are you seeing, that the market is not seeing? Why doesnÕt the market seem to believe in that innovation, and all the things that you put in place? What are they missing about Snap?""Right. Now, thereÕs been some reports that Evan looks at the long-term. Is that-, do you think that thatÕs the right way to look at your company, if youÕre a public company CEO, not worry about the markets and the day-to-day, and look at the long-term?","ÊLook, I cannot really comment on what Evan does or doesnÕt do, thatÕs-, I think you need to ask him, but I think, you know, if you look at-,","Right. Now, thereÕs been some reports that Evan looks at the long-term. Is that-, do you think that thatÕs the right way to look at your company, if youÕre a public company CEO, not worry about the markets and the day-to-day, and look at the long-term?""So, you know, you guys would work together on this, so would you talk about the long-term-, how much would you talk about the short-term, and what you needed to share and show investors?","Yeah, look, I think what-, I think itÕs really- have to appreciate what I did during the work was, thatÕs probably not the right thing to talk about, because of a variety of reasons, but I think if you take a step back, and look at the people who build big businesses, you know, they always really have to believe in long-term, and-, and, you know, if you donÕt execute-, primarily in the technology space, the world has changed so fast, if you donÕt take a long-term view, and just really manage business, from day to day, and quarter to quarter, you will miss a lot of different things. So, I think, you know, my interactions with a lot of great entrepreneurs, you know, they always really focus on long-term, so I think thatÕs a good thing to do, but also, at the same time, you obviously have to recognize that long-term consists of a series of short-terms, but focus-, losing focus on long-term, and who your customers are, is never the right thing to do, so I think all great entrepreneurs should focus on long-term.","So, you know, you guys would work together on this, so would you talk about the long-term-, how much would you talk about the short-term, and what you needed to share and show investors?""Right, and, you know, I know that Evan, and you working with him, big picture, you have this vision for Snap to be essential, right, especially based on the camera. Is there a business plan to get there? Why is execution taking so long?","ÊI think-, you know, I probably would beg the question with that, you know, because I think-, you know, thereÕs very few companies Ð you know, in China, obviously, that happens all the time, apparently Ð but outside China, thereÕs very few companies that goes from $0 to $1.2 billion dollar revenue, run rate revenue, in 45 months. So, thatÕs-, to me, itÕs a pretty good execution, but","Right, and, you know, I know that Evan, and you working with him, big picture, you have this vision for Snap to be essential, right, especially based on the camera. Is there a business plan to get there? Why is execution taking so long?"YouÕre happy with that?,"IÕm very proud of it, what we achieved.",YouÕre happy with that?"Okay. What have you learned from your time at Snap, then? What lessons are you going to take, when you start your own business?","Look, I think-, a few things. I think-, you know, I think, one, really continue to build a great team, surround yourself with really, really smart people, bring a-, create a great culture that is transparent, and-, you know, and be deliberate, very deliberate what decisions you make.","Okay. What have you learned from your time at Snap, then? What lessons are you going to take, when you start your own business?""ÊLetÕs talk a little bit about what was going on at Snap, when you were there, you were Chief Strategy Officer, and, all of a sudden, Instagram starts doing some very similar things that Snap was doing. What was that like? How did your strategy change, or not change? Did you start to pay more attention to Instagram? Or were you paying attention all along?","ÊI think-, look, I think, again, the right way to run a business is really focus on how you continue to innovate your product, and the moment you cannot innovate, you know, you are not be able to succeed. You know, I think if you look at, in the mobile, whatÕs happening, that people are continually spending more and more time on mobile devices, and the time spent on mobile devices will continue to grow, and as the time spent on mobile continues to grow, everybodyÕs trying to fight for how can they capture more share, and the only way youÕre going to get it is through innovation, and continuing to build the best product and best engagement.","ÊLetÕs talk a little bit about what was going on at Snap, when you were there, you were Chief Strategy Officer, and, all of a sudden, Instagram starts doing some very similar things that Snap was doing. What was that like? How did your strategy change, or not change? Did you start to pay more attention to Instagram? Or were you paying attention all along?""Right, and SnapÕs product is still more innovative? Would you say that? To Instagram? Is Instagram now creating its own, or is it still copying?","I think theyÕre very different products, in many different ways. There are obviously a lot of similarities, but then thereÕs a lot of differentiation, so thereÕs a couple of differences, right? So, in Snap, you open to a camera, so you actually record your experience. In Instagram, you go there, and you actually open to someone elseÕs experience. A very different experience. While they have a lot of similarities, they also have a lot of differences like that. For example, Snap has products like maps, you know, Instagram doesnÕt. So, I think, you know, while we focus a lot on the different similarities, thereÕs-, also thereÕs a lot of different things, that the different products have, and I think, long-term, who is going to win will ultimately depend on who is going to continue to innovate.","Right, and SnapÕs product is still more innovative? Would you say that? To Instagram? Is Instagram now creating its own, or is it still copying?""Is it a zero sum game, then, if you say it depends on whoÕs going to win? Or can both win?","ÊI think, if you look at markets like China, there are multiple players that exist, time spent continue to-, perfect example is if you look at the network television, right? There are ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, they all create different kind of shows, but you have four different networks who are doing really, really well.","Is it a zero sum game, then, if you say it depends on whoÕs going to win? Or can both win?""LetÕs talk a little bit-, I would love to get your view on the very bad year for Facebook. How do you see-, where have they misstepped? Have they? And what do you think needs to happen now? Not just what Facebook needs to do, but perhaps in terms of regulation?","So, two different questions. I think tech companies, as theyÕre becoming really, really big, you know, there will be-, you know, obviously, theyÕre impacting a lot of peopleÕs lives, theyÕre impacting a lot of different businesses, and when that happens, you know, there has to be some sort of regulations. But I think one of the things thatÕs really, really important, is that it has to be smart regulations. Right? I think-, I am not opposed to having regulations, but what-, we really need to be very, very mindful that the regulations we are doing are the smart regulations. Because I think-, take an example of the banking industry, right? In 2008, the financial crisis happened, all these different regulations came along, you know, because-, I think probably one of the goals was, make the banks safer, letÕs make sure that theyÕre not too big to fail. Ten years later, you know, the US biggest banks are still the biggest banks, and theyÕre bigger than ever. So, I donÕt-, I donÕt think-, are those-, so now I really have to take a step back, and say, ÕWere those regulations really smart? What happened to all the smaller businesses? What banks? What happened to all these community banks? So, again, I think one of the reasons the technology companies are really, really being very successful, is that thereÕs a lot of entrepreneurs who are able to come and build great businesses, and suddenly, if you want to bring regulations, thatÕs fine, but those regulations have to be smart, so that it doesnÕt stifle, you know, innovation. And I think thatÕs really, really important.","LetÕs talk a little bit-, I would love to get your view on the very bad year for Facebook. How do you see-, where have they misstepped? Have they? And what do you think needs to happen now? Not just what Facebook needs to do, but perhaps in terms of regulation?""ÊIn the case of Facebook, have they mishandled their usersÕ data?","ÊLook, I think-, I donÕt have all the details to really talk about what they did or they didnÕt, you know, but-,","ÊIn the case of Facebook, have they mishandled their usersÕ data?""Right. So, youÕre saying, essentially, there could be more skeletons in the closet?","I have no idea. I think, you know, if I were running that business, and issues like that, I would probably look in to it, those other area, that code of conduct thatÕs something I can be proud of.","Right. So, youÕre saying, essentially, there could be more skeletons in the closet?"What do you use Instagram for and what do you use Snap for?,"ÊUh, I use Snap for communications, I use Snap, too, for expressing my day-to-day life. And Instagram, I use to look at some influencers, or celebrities, you know.",What do you use Instagram for and what do you use Snap for?"But isnÕt that what Snap is supposed to do, too? You think about someone, like, uh-, which-, Kylie Jenner, who-,","No, Snap is-, Snap-, Snap is more of a visual communications, right? So, the company started with the core thesis that people are communicating more and more with pictures, and-, and thatÕs how the familial communication came, that you take pictures, and you communicate with pictures, and-, whereas Instagram is you are basically putting your best scene. And itÕs great, like, look, I can-, in my opinion, they serve, you know, two different objectives, and thatÕs fine.","But isnÕt that what Snap is supposed to do, too? You think about someone, like, uh-, which-, Kylie Jenner, who-,""But, here is the catch in your argument. And that catch is, the supporters of this government, the sympathizers of this government and many liberal voices in Pakistan are saying that this is a test case for democracy, that an elected government should be allowed to complete its tenure, and why is the Opposition pushing for an early election?","Well, in normal circumstances I would agree. But now what is this government trying to do? It's trying to demolish an independent Supreme Court. Are early elections going to destroy our democracy? Or, if the independent judiciary is destroyed, would that destroy our democracy? Surely, the third world is third world because they do not have an independent justice system; and criminals come in to power to loot the country and they have no checks and balances. Pakistan, as I said, has moved on. First time, we've had an independent Supreme Court. Now, if this government takes on the Supreme Court just so that it can protect Asif Zardari's corruption of billions of dollars, I'm afraid that if you stand, if people stand by the judiciary and it wins, then our democracy wins. If our judiciary loses, our democracy loses.","But, here is the catch in your argument. And that catch is, the supporters of this government, the sympathizers of this government and many liberal voices in Pakistan are saying that this is a test case for democracy, that an elected government should be allowed to complete its tenure, and why is the Opposition pushing for an early election?""What do you say to those voices in your country who are suggesting that in some ways, the judiciary and the military today are on the same side in this debate?","ÊI don't know if there is any indication of that, but all I know is that the Supreme Court has been very lenient with this government. I mean the day the NRO was struck down - an NRO brokered by the Bush Administration - which Condoleezza Rice writes in her book, that she helped waive off all corruption cases of Benazir and 8,000 people. Corruption cases of over a trillion rupees were waived off. Would they do that in their own countries? Would they do this? Allow criminals to be given an amnesty? And then allow them to contest elections? And then the biggest crook becomes the President? Would they allow that?","What do you say to those voices in your country who are suggesting that in some ways, the judiciary and the military today are on the same side in this debate?""Their argument, of course, is that these were political cases. They were acts of vendetta, and you needed the amnesty to create a democracy movement. That's their argument.","Absolute nonsense. They destroyed our democracy by that NRO election. Nowhere in the western world are criminals allowed to contest elections. These were not political cases; Asif Ali Zardari's case was in the Swiss courts. He was already convicted; he was on appeal. All these cases were withdrawn, thanks to the Americans, because they wanted a puppet government here, which would bomb its own people. And so, when Musharraf was weakening, they got them together, as Condoleezza Rice so shamefully, but triumphantly, says in her book. And so, we got this government of crooks. And the Supreme Court, whenever it challenged them, the government took the Supreme Court on. Almost making out that if the Supreme Court took on the crooked politicians, democracy was at stake. So, hiding behind democracy, they kept looting the country. Never have we had so much corruption in this country as today. And, so therefore, whoever says that the Army is behind it, I think that, if anything, the Supreme Court has been very lenient because they allowed them to go on plundering this country. There's been one scam after another. And yet, the country has helplessly been looking at the Supreme Court to take action. And this government has stonewalled the Supreme Court. So, finally, the Supreme Court has passed a contempt notice on the Prime Minister and everyone is watching if the government tries to now defy the Supreme Court, they won't know what hit them. Because my party and the tsunami will be in the streets and they won't be able to contain it.","Their argument, of course, is that these were political cases. They were acts of vendetta, and you needed the amnesty to create a democracy movement. That's their argument.""What about the fact that on the same day that the Prime Minister gets this contempt notice, he also wins the trust vote that asserts the supremacy of Parliament. Does that change the game?",This Parliament is a coalition of crooks.,"What about the fact that on the same day that the Prime Minister gets this contempt notice, he also wins the trust vote that asserts the supremacy of Parliament. Does that change the game?""I was just going to say that we're sitting here talking to you outside this beautiful home because there is no electricity, even in Imran Khan's home. Why are politicians not talking about these issues? Why is it such a rhetorical campaign about everything else here in Pakistan except the economy?","No, Barkha, we do talk about it. We've had demonstrations of electricity and gas shortages. But, unfortunately, everyday a new issue comes along. You wake up and there is another issue. Another scam, you know, rental power scam, then you wake up and there is some fertilizer scam of billions of rupees. Therefore, you know, you don't know what to concentrate on. People were hoping that this government would finally leave. People are sick of this government and waiting for them to go. But this is an issue. What is in the Supreme Court? The whole country is now waiting, expecting the Supreme Court to dispense justice.","I was just going to say that we're sitting here talking to you outside this beautiful home because there is no electricity, even in Imran Khan's home. Why are politicians not talking about these issues? Why is it such a rhetorical campaign about everything else here in Pakistan except the economy?"Are you looking for an early election?,"Well, for our party, obviously. I mean, if the government lasts till the elections, it's of great benefit to us because we're gaining every day.",Are you looking for an early election?ÊSo you wouldn't want an early election?,"No, from our point of view, I mean Tehreek-e-Insaf point of view. But from Pakistan's point of view, the sooner the elections, the better. The sooner we get rid of this coalition of crooks, the better we can start rebuilding this country.",ÊSo you wouldn't want an early election?"You don't buy the argument that this is about the supremacy of Parliament, and this is about preserving that democratic supremacy?","ÊIn Pakistan's democracy, it's supremacy of the Constitution. Parliament is sovereign, but the Constitution is supreme. So what this government is doing is defying the Constitution. By standing up to, by defying the orders of the Supreme Court, it is actually going against the Constitution. In fact, there are about 18 judgments of the Supreme Court this government has defied so far.","You don't buy the argument that this is about the supremacy of Parliament, and this is about preserving that democratic supremacy?""I want to ask you, there are those who say Imran Khan's being backed by the Pakistani army. I read this all the time in the Pakistani media.","Well, this is what all the politicians are petrified of. Because they don't know what's happened; how come this tsunami has suddenly built up? But if the Army has now helped us, then surely it must be manipulating the Pew polls, which are American opinion polls where Tehreek-e-Insaf has been number one for six months now. YouGov polls in England; there we've been number one. All the polls which are conducted in Pakistan, we're the number one party now. So surely, they must be manipulating that. And then, a quarter of million people turn up in Lahore, and a quarter of a million in Karachi. General Musharraf, when he was the head of the ISI and the army, he couldn't pull a miniscule crowd compared to that. Forget about the passion in the crowd. Aren't they overestimating the army?","I want to ask you, there are those who say Imran Khan's being backed by the Pakistani army. I read this all the time in the Pakistani media.""General Musharraf, since you have mentioned him, is now looking to be part of your alliance.","Well, unfortunately, I mean it is kind of him to want to be a part of our alliance but we can't accept him. Simply because the NRO the reason why these criminals are sitting, this Asif Zardari, is because of General Musharraf. A deal brokered between him and...","General Musharraf, since you have mentioned him, is now looking to be part of your alliance."So you will have nothing to do with him?,"Absolutely not. And my advice to him is, he shouldn't come to Pakistan because his life would be in danger.",So you will have nothing to do with him?"ÊBut, you know, when I was interviewing him in London a couple of months ago, he said that you were the best of the available options. But he also said that, ""Imran thinks that running Pakistan is like being the captain of a cricket team"".","ÊWell, time will tell whether the captain of a cricket team does a better job with Pakistan or the army chief who took over and left this mess.","ÊBut, you know, when I was interviewing him in London a couple of months ago, he said that you were the best of the available options. But he also said that, ""Imran thinks that running Pakistan is like being the captain of a cricket team""."So you will have nothing to do with him?,"No, we cannot have any alliance with General Musharraf. Actually, we have no plans of any alliances. We will fight alone.",So you will have nothing to do with him?"But if you do not get the numbers, you will need help from somebody. You may?","ÊI am confident that - I have been saying this before - that we will sweep this election. And I am confident because I know I am amongst the people. People have changed. This is a new Pakistan. And the youth in Pakistan, which is 70% of the population, they have already made up their minds. They are not making up their minds; they have made up their minds. Just go to any university, college and you will know where the youth stands. And youth and women are always in the forefront of the change. And this is where Tehreek-e-Insaf is way ahead of all the other parties. So why would we want alliance with those parties which represent the status quo? Which is all of them sitting in power. All of them have benefited from this corrupt system and most of them, in fact all their leaders, have massive corruption cases against them. Why would I want alliance with them? I'd much rather, if I don't get the numbers, sit in the Opposition and be a proper Opposition in Pakistan, than form a coalition with these crooks.","But if you do not get the numbers, you will need help from somebody. You may?""ÊBut tell me, what do you make of the very public spat between the civilian government and the military that began with the Memogate controversy? It's quite rare to see that in Pakistan.","ÊWell, but these are exceptional circumstances.

It's sub judice and there is a Judicial Commission, which is now investigating. And I don't know what comes out of it.

Eventually, what is the worst that can happen to this government? Early elections. Early elections will strengthen our democracy. My only fear is, if the government demolishes the Supreme Court, which they have made every effort. They have bribed lawyers; they have sort of tried to get the Supreme Court Bar Association pitted against the Supreme Court. They have done everything. But actually people have stood behind the Supreme Court. If you look at all the opinion polls, the Supreme Court is the most respected institution in Pakistan. So people are standing behind it. And this government, in order to protect the corruption of Asif Zardari and his cronies, is now trying to demolish it. So, if they win, if this government wins, that's where our democracy will be destroyed. That's when I see chaos. But if there are early elections, it will only strengthen our democracy.","So how does this play out? Because you know that the world is waiting to see.

What is west as geography? It's like being anti-Asian, anti- Australian. What is this nonsense? I have been anti-war on terror from day one and time has proven that, whatever I have said has proven to be correct. I opposed military actions; I always said there was a political solution.

This is a Muslim country. Most of the people pray here. Am I not respecting them? If I am a politician, should I try and go against the sentiments of the people of Pakistan? And thirdly when they say I am using religion, I am only in politics. If I were not spiritual I would not be in politics. Spirituality makes you selfless. I have everything God would ever, whatever I want from The Almighty, I have. The only reason I have come into politics is I feel it's a responsibility because I have so much; I should try and do something for the people. I've built a hospital, I've built a university, I've done a lot of work in the floods, I have helped building villages. But, should we, people like me who have everything, all doors are open for me in the society. Should I sit back and watch my country being plundered by criminals and take the easy open? Or should I take them on? And it's my spirituality. It's the spirituality that tells you that you should be selfless. The more God gives you, the more he puts responsibility on you to do for other people. And so that's why I'm in politics.

She feared for your life to ask you where you stood on the blasphemy controversy in Pakistan, and I remember you told me that you have never supported killing in the name of religion, but you accepted her argument that it was too dangerous in Pakistan right now to have a debate on the issue.","Okay, let's take one thing, one by one again. Religion, if it does not make you compassionate and just, every religion, every religion's basic message is that you become compassionate, selfless. You have to be compassionate to other human beings and in case of a Muslim, remember, it's Rabbana-Alim, Lord of all human beings; it's not Rabbana-Muslim, Lord of Muslims. So you have the responsibility to be compassionate to all human beings. So killing in the name of religion is a contradiction in terms. Number two, you have to be just. So as opposed to the animal kingdom where might is right, you have to be just in a humane society. So if these two things do not come inside your heart, then it means it's a false religion. You are using religion for other means and I'm talking about every religion. Now what you talked about what Jemima said, she is right. Pakistan society, thanks to this war on terror, is totally polarized now.

And let me tell you if Islam is threatened, there is going to be no limit of people willing to kill for protecting the religion. Therefore, you need a different approach and while this is depressing, what was most encouraging was my rallies, everyone came, religious people, westernised people, everyone came to the rally.

That's quite funny.","In university, yes, Mick Jagger and Karl Marx. Even now I think I find someone like Tariq Ali who is not religious but who is a Leftist. I find my views are far closer to Tariq Ali than probably anyone else. So I don't fit in those stereotypes. I'm deeply spiritual. I lead my life with my faith but I'm totally leftist in my thinking, I'm anti-neo liberal economics, I think there should be compassion in the world, I believe in a welfare state. So they can't place me and secondly as far as India goes that is your question, I do believe that there has to be a resolution on Kashmir but I don't believe in any military solution, I don't believe in any militancy. I believe it should be politically, it should be done on the table. There should be a political roadmap. I do believe that Indian Army should not be there because in 20 years what it hasn't solved by six-seven hundred thousand Indian troops, it's not going to solve in the future too. I don't believe in the military solution.","You wrote in your book that you had two idols in university, Mick Jagger and Karl Marx. That's quite funny.""ÊBut are you tracking the changes, for example, on the Indian, on Jammu and Kashmir, as we call it? There have been elections. There have been Panchayat elections, huge turnouts, a reduction in militancy. The world has changed. And whatever you may criticise General Pervez Musharraf for, there was a four-point formula that he put on the table, that seems to have become the accepted template for going forward.","Well, that was a positive. Yes, I agree with you. And I do believe that there has to be a political settlement and a move forward. Look, there needs to be a road map. And a political road map so there is some sort of a political solution which stops this, you know, tide of extremism and also helping the rightists on both sides of the border, who exploit the situation. And secondly, I believe in relations, normal relations, trade, everything, because really the sub-continent is suffering. We have a great opportunity. This is the fastest growing, probably, region in the world, China, India, and if Pakistan was stable and we had a decent relationship, if we lived as decent neighbours. We have a great opportunity of lifting people out of poverty in the whole sub-continent, which should be our main concern. We should be competing in alleviating poverty in both countries. That should be our goal. So, I am not a hardliner. I believe that when, Inshallah, our government comes to power, we will have a relationship based on truth. There will be no double games. Whatever will be said, whatever will be promised, will be upheld. There will be no cloak and dagger games and I would like that our intelligence would not be operating in either countries. Neither will we be blaming RAW for Balochistan and neither would India be blaming our agencies for any terrorism.","ÊBut are you tracking the changes, for example, on the Indian, on Jammu and Kashmir, as we call it?

It will be a government, which will take responsibility for everything happening in Pakistan.",Would you like to see more civilian control over the ISI and the military?"Tell me this, because I know you come to Mumbai often, the shadow of 26/11 as India see a Hafiz Saeed saying all kinds of inflammatory things at his rallies. We see him being able to operate with impunity. What would you say to Indians? You have so many Indian friends and you love Mumbai. You come there so often.","Look, Hafiz Saeed's case is in the Supreme Court. Everyone trusts the Supreme Court. You look at the polls today people are standing behind the Supreme Court. I always believe in the due process of law. If anyone is accused of anything you must put him through a court. I completely did not agree with this American killing of Osama bin Laden. I think they should have dealt with him the way they dealt with Saddam Hussein, because Saddam Hussein was tried and executed. But it did not have the same martyrdom thing, which Osama has had. I mean Osama is a martyr because of the way in which they killed him.","Tell me this, because I know you come to Mumbai often, the shadow of 26/11 as India see a Hafiz Saeed saying all kinds of inflammatory things at his rallies.

You come there so often."You think he is a martyr here in Pakistan?,"Amongst various people he is a martyr. In the Muslim world you will find that amongst various people he is a martyr. The way to avoid that was to put him through a trial, accuse him. Look, civilised countries follow the due process of law.",You think he is a martyr here in Pakistan?"But does that mean you endorse them? In a way aren't you legitimising their very, very radical, dangerous views?","Tell me, today the Americans are engaging the Taliban now. They are allowing an office, as I said, to open in Qatar. They are engaging them. Does that mean they are endorsing their views? I mean, this is what always should have been done. Politicians believe in political settlements. You don't believe in marginalising people. You believe in bringing them in the mainstream. We were petrified when the BJP came to power, that here is an extreme party. But you found that the moment it came...","But does that mean you endorse them? In a way aren't you legitimising their very, very radical, dangerous views?""Let's end by talking a little bit about you and your personal journey; from being a cricketing superstar to being seen as a playboy, party boy, to now being seen as somebody who is spiritual, a very serious politician. Your commitment to politics has cost you personally in many ways. It cost you your marriage in many ways. You write about that quite candidly in your book.","Yes. But I have to say that my spirituality hasn't made me into an angel, I am still a humble sinner.","Let's end by talking a little bit about you and your personal journey; from being a cricketing superstar to being seen as a playboy, party boy, to now being seen as somebody who is spiritual, a very serious politician.

You write about that quite candidly in your book.""And now your kids, you write about that in your book, growing up, in a sense, far away from you. You worry about that? That's a big cost.","Well, that's why. One of the reasons I wrote the book was because I was scared that they wouldn't know what I was, and they wouldn't know how I evolved into what I became, and they wouldn't know anything about spirituality, because, sadly, in western societies you hardly see any spirituality. The material has become so predominant, and sadly, also in our westernised elites in India and Pakistan, we have become so material. So I wanted them to have another perspective to life. What is religion? What is spirituality? What is Islam? What is being a human being and what should be your purpose of existence? So that's why I wrote my book. I had my two sons in mind because I worried that it's such a materialistic society now, and what you've seen now, this neo liberal economics. This greed, naked greed, where the rich are getting rich and poor people are getting poorer and when the rich make mistakes the poor fund them through the taxes, the blunders they make. So, I wanted them to have another perspective. And I really, yes, I do worry about them. I wish I had more influence over them and the dilemmas they face. I wish I could influence them more.","And now your kids, you write about that in your book, growing up, in a sense, far away from you. You worry about that? That's a big cost.""But you are standing, at the cusp I think, of a big change for you? A big move forward, how confident, are you, in the end, that you are Pakistan's future?","Well, it's like when I used to step on the cricket field I always thought I could win.","But you are standing, at the cusp I think, of a big change for you? A big move forward, how confident, are you, in the end, that you are Pakistan's future?""Well, Imran Khan, as you've been saying now for a while, your time has come. Thank you so much, a pleasure to talk to you.",My Pleasure.,"Well, Imran Khan, as you've been saying now for a while, your time has come. Thank you so much, a pleasure to talk to you."
